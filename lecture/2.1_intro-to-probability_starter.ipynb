    "> The **probability** of a specified event is the chance or likelihood that it will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of viewing probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experimental:** repeatedly conducting an experiment and predicting future outcomes based on past results.\n",
    "* **Subjective:** an educated guess with accuracy that cannot be verified.\n",
    "* **Theoretical:** Suppose we have a situation with $n$ equally-likely possible outcomes, where $m$ of those $n$ outcomes correspond to a particular event, then the probability of that event is $\\frac{m}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll deal mostly with theoretical probability. Before we define this in a mathematical sense, we have a few more definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Outcome**  \n",
    "An outcome is the result of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Event**  \n",
    "An event is any particular outcome or group of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Simple Event**  \n",
    "A simple event is an event that cannot be broken down further.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Sample Space**  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic Probability\n",
    "Now we can get to the way we will define basic probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Basic Probability**  \n",
    "Given that all outcomes are equally likely, we can compute the probability of an event $E$ as\n",
    "$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of outcomes for the event }E}{\\text{Total number of equally-likely outcomes}} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "We can report this value as a fraction, a decimal, or as a percent, depending on what makes the most sense in the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that an impossible event will have zero probability and event that is guaranteed to happen will have a probability of 1. In other words\n",
    "* Impossible event: $P(E) = 0$\n",

    "### Calculating Basic Probability\n",
    "Now how would we execute this with code? Of course we can just type `1/6` in a code cell and we'll get a decimal result. What if we wanted to calculate another probability? Let's try and do this with some basic variables so that we can easily input values and get a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#128187; **Tech Note**  \n",
    "We'll use some longer variables here so it makes it easier to see what the code is doing. For long variable names, you can make use of `tab` completion. Just start typing the beginning of a variable name and then hit the `tab` key and Jupyter Lab will complete the variable name. If you have several variables that start the same way, a list will pop up asking which you want."
