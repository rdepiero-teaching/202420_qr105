    "### Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we have only used the basic functionality of Python. Aside from our \"Guess the Number\" game, we have not yet had the need to import any additional libraries. In simplest terms, a library is a collection of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of libraries. The standard python libraries are the libraries that come with any standard installation of Python. A list of them can be found here at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also non-standard libraries. Most of the ones we will use are already installed on your system because they come with the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We gain access to these functions using the `import` command. For example, in our \"Guess the Number\" game we used the `random` library. We were able to access these functions after we included the line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import random\n",
    "```\n",
    "This imported all of the functions from the `random` libary. Sometimes, we may want to only import a single function or a collection of functions from a library, which are organized into \"sub-libraries\". For example, in this notebook we'll make use of the functions `permutations()` and `combinations()` functions from the `itertools` library. We'll do this with the line\n",
    "```\n",
    "from itertools import permutations \n",
    "```\n",
    "and this will import the `permutations()` function. We can also import the entire library, but give it a 'nickname' or shorthand as we're coding by doing the following\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import itertools as it\n",
    "```\n",
    "When writing a python script, good practice is to import all of your libaries at the top of the file (we'll see this next week). Python notebooks make this a little harder, because you can easily lose where you imported a particular library.\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#128187; **Tech Note**\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use the bad practice of importing the library in the code cell that we need to use it. When doing your own work, you want to try and avoid this, and include a cell at the top of your notebook that includes all of the libraries you'll be using.\n",
