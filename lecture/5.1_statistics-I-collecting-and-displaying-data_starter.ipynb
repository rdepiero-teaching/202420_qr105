    "## Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a population is identified, you need to choose a sampling method. There are many ways to sample a population. In choosing a method to use, you want to be sure to avoid **sampling bias**. A sampling method is biased if every member of the population doesnâ€™t have equal likelihood of being in the sample. There are many ways to sample a population, but there is one goal we need to keep in mind: we would like the sample to be representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about a few types of sampling methods. By ensuring randomness in our sampling method, we're more likely to get results that represent the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Simple Random Sample**  \n",
    "A random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.  A simple random sample is one in which every member of the population and any group of members has an equal probability of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using a random number generator to select students based on their student ID number.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Stratified Sample**  \n",
    "In stratified sampling, a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup with sample sizes proportional to the size of the subgroup in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, surveying students at Regis College, where random samples are taken from students that are Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors, or Seniors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Systematic Random Sample**  \n",
    "In systematic sampling, every $n$ th member of the population is selected to be in the sample.\n",

    "For example, choosing every 10th student in the roster organized by student ID number.\n",

    "> **Cluster Sample**  \n",
    "In cluster sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (clusters), and a set of subgroups are selected to be in the sample\n",

    "For example, selecting 10 classes and giving a survey to all students in those classes.\n",
